# Pizza Sales Report Analysis Using PowerBI and SQL

The "Pizza Sales" project is a comprehensive analysis of a pizza store's operational data from the year 2015. The dataset, originally in CSV format, has been systematically migrated to and integrated within a MySQL server to enhance the efficiency of querying and analysis. The project's primary objective is to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and actionable insights from the data, providing a solid foundation for strategic decision-making within the pizza business.

### About the Project:
1. **Data Gathering and Integration**:
   The project commences with the collection of a CSV-formatted dataset, encompassing comprehensive details on the pizza store's transactions, products, customers, orders, and sales. 
   This dataset is subsequently transferred to a MySQL server, ensuring data integrity and structured storage for efficient querying and analysis.
2. **Data Cleansing**:
   Prior to analysis, the data undergoes a rigorous cleansing and transformation process to correct any inconsistencies or errors. This critical step ensures that the subsequent analysis 
   is conducted on accurate and reliable data.
3. **SQL Database Design and Querying**:
   SQL queries are formulated and executed to extract meaningful insights and KPIs. Some potential queries include:
   Total sales revenue for the year.
   Best-selling pizza flavors.
   Customer demographics and ordering trends.
   Busiest days and times for orders.
   Average order value.
   Monthly sales growth rate.
4. **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Calculation**:
   Meticulously calculated using SQL queries to evaluate the pizza store's performance and success. These KPIs include metrics such as sales growth, customer retention rates, average 
   order value, and other critical measures. The insights derived from these metrics provide a clear understanding of the store's strengths and identify opportunities for improvement.
5. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**:
   The extracted insights and KPIs are subsequently visualized through an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard. This dashboard leverages charts, graphs, and tables to present a 
   comprehensive overview of the store's performance throughout the year. Stakeholders can easily drill down into specific details, making the visuals a powerful tool for enhancing the 
   decision-making process.
